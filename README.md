# Learning causal representations based on a GAE embedded autoencoder
## Introduction
We proposed a graph-autoencoder-embedded autoencoder (GeAE) to learn invariant representations across domains for robust domain adaption.
## Usage 
--The code is tested on python3.7 and tensorflow1.13.1.

--The model of GeAE can be found in 'GeAE_model.py'. Besides, we provide an example on a synthetic dataset which can be found in 'synthetic_dataset.py'.
